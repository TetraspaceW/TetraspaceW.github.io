  <p>This is the home page of ðŸ’Ž Tetraspace ðŸ’Ž, and will probably at some point in the future contain lots of cool
    Tetraspace facts and content!</p>
  <h2>Things I Care About</h2>
  <p>Tetra is a big fan of rationalism and <a href="./effective-altruism.html">effective altruism</a>. I think at some
    point this century, the <a href="./cybersingularity.html">cybersingularity</a> will occur, in which AIs become
    smarter than people in the non-metaphorical impossible-to-miss way that results in things like planets being
    dismantled. I think that making AIs that do what we want them to is primarily a mathematical problem that we don't
    yet know how to solve.</p>
  <p>The most effective way for an individual donor to give is through a <a
      href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/donor-lottery">donor lottery</a>. The Center for Effective Altruism runs
    one once a year, <strong>and is currently running one now!</strong> Since effective altruism is dominated by <a
      href="https://80000hours.org/2021/07/effective-altruism-growing/">two large donors</a>, I tentatively think that
    the most effective intervention is meta-charity to attract or improve the effectiveness of more large donors,
    focused on those who are good at funding AI safety researchers; I will think about this harder if I am chosen to
    allocate a donor lottery pool.</p>
  <h2>Tetraspace's Shills List</h2>
  <p><a href="./tetraspace-shills-list.html">Tetraspace's Shills List</a>, a list of works of fiction that I think are
    good and that you should read or watch or play or whatever.

  <p>Sometimes I like to write fiction; here are links to stuff that I've published online.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <em><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24324157">When We Learned of Trump</a></em> (2444 words,
      complete) - When Donald Trump was elected, he set the clocks back 50 years. Then the next election came, and the
      next<a href="./when-we-learned-of-trump.html">.</a></li>
    <li> <em><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/30743807/chapters/75878828">k/Harvesters</a></em> (323 words,

      Black Orb.</li>
    <li> Some stuff on the <em><a href="https://verse-and-dimensions.fandom.com/wiki/User:Holomanga">Verse and
          Dimensions Wiki</a></em> - Collaborative fiction about cosmic entities where omnipotence is considered
