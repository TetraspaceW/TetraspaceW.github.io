    <h2>Things I Care About</h2>
    <p>I am a big fan of rationalism and <a href="./effective-altruism.html">effective altruism</a>. I think at some
        point this century, the <a href="./cybersingularity.html">cybersingularity</a> will occur, in which AIs become
        smarter than people in the non-metaphorical impossible-to-miss way that results in things like planets being
        dismantled.</p>
    <p>The most effective way for an individual donor to give is through a <a
            href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/donor-lottery">donor lottery</a>. The Center for Effective
        Altruism runs one once a year. Since effective altruism is dominated by <a
            href="https://80000hours.org/2021/07/effective-altruism-growing/">two large donors</a>, I tentatively think
        that the most effective intervention is meta-charity to attract or improve the effectiveness of more large
        donors, focused on those who are good at funding AI safety researchers; I will think about this harder if I am
        chosen to allocate a donor lottery pool.</p>
    <p>Note that these two large donors mean that if you work on AI alignment, the most important object-issue level of
        all time, you could be well-funded. Scott Alexander <a
            href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-run-a-microgrants">writes</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>(what actually happened was that the Long Term Future Fund approached me and said ‚Äúwe will fund every
        single good AI-related proposal you get, just hand them to us, you don‚Äôt have to worry about it‚Äù. Then I had
        another person say ‚Äúhand me the ones Long Term Future Fund doesn‚Äôt want, and I‚Äôll fund those.‚Äù Have I mentioned
        it‚Äôs a good time to start AI related charities?)</blockquote>
