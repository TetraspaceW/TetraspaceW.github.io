    <h2>Things I Care About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a big fan of rationalism and
      <a href="./effective-altruism.html">effective altruism</a>. I think at
      some point this century, the
      <a href="./cybersingularity.html">cybersingularity</a> will occur, in
      which AIs become smarter than people in the non-metaphorical
      impossible-to-miss way that results in things like planets being
      dismantled, and that we are currently not on track for this to happen in a
      way that leaves survivors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most effective way for an individual donor to give is through a
      <a href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/donor-lottery"
        >donor lottery</a
      >. The Center for Effective Altruism runs one once a year. The most
      important object-level issue, potentially for disbursing , is AI
      notkilleveryoneism, and the situation for AI safety is currently looking
      dire;

      for a view of the awful state our civilisation is in on this issue.

    <p>
      For the AI safety funding situation, Scott Alexander
      <a
        href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/so-you-want-to-run-a-microgrants"
        >wrote on Feb 9th</a
      >; remains to be seen how the collapse of FTX affected this (made the
      expected funding situation worse, of course, by a third and concentrated
      in x-risk areas), though Open Philanthropy <em>is</em> still going strong:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      (what actually happened was that the Long Term Future Fund approached me
      and said ‚Äúwe will fund every single good AI-related proposal you get, just
      hand them to us, you don‚Äôt have to worry about it‚Äù. Then I had another
      person say ‚Äúhand me the ones Long Term Future Fund doesn‚Äôt want, and I‚Äôll
      fund those.‚Äù Have I mentioned it‚Äôs a good time to start AI related
      charities?)
