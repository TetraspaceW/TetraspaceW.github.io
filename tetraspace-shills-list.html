            Web serials. Seemingly unrelated short stories about a world with
            new physics and some scientists putting it to good use that come
            together later. Things escalate. The world is destroyed, but there
            are spares. Ed, Fine Structure, and Ra are totally different web
            serials, but they're the same genre, I like them for the same
            reason, and the author writes it well.
