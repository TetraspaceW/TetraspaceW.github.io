  <h1>What to do if you don't have an eating disorder</h1>

  <p>That title is not a typo. This is a blog post of what to do if you <strong>don't</strong> have an eating disorder. That is to say, the target audience of this blog post is people who <strong>do not</strong> have eating disorders.</p>

  <p>People with eating disorders will find this blog post at best irrelevant, and at worst incredibly demeaning and dehumanizing, in one sense because I'm going to be doing a lot of talking about your real life experiences like they're the <em>worst thing</em> that can happen to a person.</p>

  <p>My recommendation is that if you had, have, or will have an eating disorder, do not read this blog post. Or at least mentally sign a waiver before you read it. I'm not fucking joking around here. Guidelines on how to talk about eating disorders are triggering to me. I <em>can't write for those people</em> and <em>am not doing so currently</em>. </p>

  <p>Okay, so let's begin.</p>
  
  <h2> Why they Happen. </h2>

  <p>The first thing you need to know is <strong>why eating disorders happen</strong>. Forget everything you learned about how eating disorders are when the demon <a href="https://vocal.media/viva/society-s-beauty-standards">Society</a> tells you to be skinny and then you stop eating in order to achieve this body type at status gunpoint.</p>

  <p>No, an eating disorder is what happens <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/the-no-nonsense-guide/guide">when your starvation response stops working properly</a> (read that link, by the way - it's good). The starvation response is exactly what its sounds like - it's what your body does when it notices that it's starving to death.</p>

  <p>Some number - about 90%, let's put a fake number there - of people have a starvation response that tells them to move less and eat more if they're starving to death. This is good. They eat more, and they stop starving to death. So far, so good.</p>

  <p>But the rest - about 10%, if we're rolling with my previous fake number - have a starvation response that tells them to move more and eat less if they're starving to death. If, for any reason, these people stop eating enough that their BMI drops below what's needed for the starvation response to take hold, they're never able to eat again (because their starvation response stops them), and then they die.</p>

  <p>For the hypothetical sake of argument, I'm going to be using "you" to talk about someone in the second group.</p>

  <p>A little digression, a story that you've heard before. In some patients with epilepsy, a treatment is performed where the two hemispheres of the brain are split (this is because the seizures start in one half of the brain, and if that half is separated off, then they don't spread to the whole brain).</p>

  <p><a href="https://physics.weber.edu/carroll/honors/split_brain.htm">Imagine an experiment where the subject is shown two images</a>, one through each eye, and using their left hand (controlled by the right hemisphere), they point to an object that corresponds to the image that they saw.</p>

  <p>In one case, the subject was shown a snowy landscape through their left eye, and a chicken's foot through their right eye; since the left hemisphere of their brain saw the snow, it chose the shovel as the corresponding object. The subject was then asked why they picked the shovel; the left hemisphere of their brain, which saw the chicken's foot, gave the explanation that "the shovel is for cleaning out the chicken coop". But this isn't why they picked it!</p>

  <p>That is, your brain has a mechanism for producing convincing justifications for things that you've done, except these justifications can be completely false (the shovel is nothing to do with the chicken's foot!), and you don't notice that this is happening because you are your brain. <em>Oh, fuck</em>.</p>

  <p>Returning to the point: If you're in starvation mode, then because <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/25/book-review-the-hungry-brain/">your lipostat</a> is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/26/anorexia-and-metabolic-set-point/">telling you that you've eaten too much</a> all the time because you're starving to death and it's broken, your brain backfills justifications for <em>this</em>. "I want to be skinny, that must be it," the brain <em>completely makes up</em>. Or maybe it's something metaphorical about control. Or "taking up space", which hurts to write because it's literally kabbalah and yet friends have said that in earnest. Because their brain has made up a justification that it obviously false, except to them, because they are their brain.</p>

  <p>And then you tell these to your therapist, who tries to talk your lipostat out of this based on the fake arguments that the brain has generated. Because the justifications are fake, and because you can't talk to a lipostat at all ever, this doesn't work.</p>

  <p>But remember - it's just the starvation response. It's just the lipostat. Mere atoms. </p>

  <h2>Recovery is Fake.</h2>

  <p>The second thing you need to know is that <strong>recovery is fake</strong>. If you get an eating disorder, you will <em>never get better</em>.</p>

  <p>In part, this is trivial - you always have the broken starvation response, there's no cure for that. Even if you eat enough every day your entire life, that will still be a feature of your body, you'll just be asymptomatic.</p>

  <p>But on another level, the prognosis is bad. I got an optimistic leaflet from Beat once about how hopeful things are and how I should send money to them. The statistic that they used? A third of people get better in a year. Another third of people get better in five. And a third third (heh) never get better, at least as long as they've been tracking.</p>

  <p>And that's <em>the optimistic lie they told me to get my money</em>.</p>

  <p>And for the people who've allegedly "recovered", they're not exactly doing as well as you or I. I hear people talk about how they always have body issues and that they will always be with them their entire life, and how relapse is ubiquitous, and how in general their life is an eternal tightrope of feeling a very strong compulsion to drive their BMI into the broken starvation response zone.</p>
  
  <p>On the face of it, this seems to kind of contradict the broken lipostat idea - surely if the only problem is that the lipostat is broken, and that's feeding false memories into your brain, then as soon as it's fixed, all the mental parts would go away and you'd truly be recovered? And you're right, this is somewhat confusing. My guess is that it's a PTSD response to long-term starvation or something, and I'll think about it more later.</p>
  
  <p>Possibly some of this is that sometimes, you've "recovered" but the lipostat is still broken - the kind of BMI that would solve the problem might be higher than the BMI that you can attain with a hypersensitivty to leptin and a stream of excuses piloting your System 2 (remember: you'll really think things so ridiculous as "I want to be skinny and that will improve my life"), so you instead stay in this liminal space of misery where you're eating far more than your body wants to but much less than it needs to and call that "recovery" while hurting all the way down. Pro: this can only happen if you've got stupidly high conscientiousness. Con: eating disorders are more common in conscientious people, because they have the willpower to stop eating for long enough to break their lipostat.</p>
  
  <p>And because <em>recovery is fake</em>, if you get an eating disorder, that's it. It's over. You're hosed. The goose is cooked. You're constantly living now at 0.776 QALYs/year, except less than that because people underestimate how bad mental health problems will be for them and overestimate how bad physical health problems will be. I once saw someone restrospectively say that their eating disorder may have been <em>negative QALYs</em>, and I'm fairly inclined to believe them.</p>
  
  <p>So these are very bad. They're caused by some genetic metabolic problem. What are you going to do about it? What can you do about it? Really, you should want to know:</p>
